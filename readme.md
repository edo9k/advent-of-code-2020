# Advent of Code 2020

I quit on the second day last year. I hope I can finish this one. 

My objective for this edition is writing the laziest js solution possible. This code here is run straight in the "input" page for the daily challenge, right on the developer console. It relies on the DOM API to fetch the input, nambely some version of `document.body.innerText.split('\n')`.

The code in this repo will be a blatant example of what **you should not do** in an actual *real life* application.
